# COMOLA Thesis

This repository contains the code and tests for three model designs developed as part of my thesis:

- `COMOLA-master-original`: The original model design.
- `COMOLA-master-layer`: The revised models with preprocessing layer.
- `COMOLA-master-nolayer`: The revised models without without preprocessing layer.

## How to Use

Each model design is located in its own directory:
- `COMOLA-master-original/`
- `COMOLA-revised-layer/`
- `COMOLA-revised-nolayer/`

Inside each directory, you will find:
- `models/`: The source code for the models (compactness, compatibility, economy).
- `_helper_functions.py` and `_helper_models.py`: For the revised versions of COMOLA, the generic models and functions used.

Please refer to the `README.md` in each directory for detailed instructions on how to run COMOLA.
